<p align="center">So far, there is no evidence that life exists on Europa, but Europa
has emerged as one of the most likely locations in the Solar System for potential
habitability. Life could exist in its under-ice ocean, perhaps in an environment
similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents. Even if Europa lacks volcanic
hydrothermal activity, a 2016 NASA study found that Earth-like levels of hydrogen and
oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice-derived
oxidants, which do not directly involve volcanism. In 2015, scientists announced that
salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on Europa,
suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining
if Europa could be habitable. The likely presence of liquid water in contact with Europa's
rocky mantle has spurred calls to send a probe there.</p></font>

Clay-like minerals (specifically, phyllosilicates), often associated with organic matter on Earth,
have been detected on the icy crust of Europa. The presence of the minerals may have been the
result of a collision with an asteroid or comet. Some scientists have speculated that life on Earth
could have been blasted into space by asteroid collisions and arrived on the moons of Jupiter in a process
called lithopanspermia.</p></font>
