<p align="right">Proxima Centauri b (also called Proxima b or Alpha Centauri Cb) is an
exoplanet orbiting in the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, which is the
<b>closest star to the Sun</b> and part of a triple star system. It is located approximately
4.2 light-years (4.0×10<sup>13</sup> km) from Earth in the constellation of Centaurus, making it and
Proxima c the closest known exoplanets to the Solar System.</p></font><br><br><br><br><br>

The habitability of Proxima Centauri b has not been established, but the planet is subject to
stellar wind pressures of more than 2,000 times those experienced by Earth from the solar wind.
This radiation and the stellar winds would likely blow any atmosphere away, leaving the subsurface as
the only potentially habitable location on that planet.</font>
