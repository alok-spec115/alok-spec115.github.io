Kepler-186f (also known by its Kepler object of interest designation KOI-571.05)
is an exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf Kepler-186, about 582 light-years
(178.5 parsecs, or nearly 5.298×10<sup>15</sup> km) from the Earth. It is the first planet
with a radius similar to Earth's to be discovered in the habitable zone of another star.
NASA's Kepler space telescope detected it using the transit method, along with four
additional planets orbiting much closer to the star (all modestly larger than Earth).
Analysis of three years of data was required to find its signal. The results were presented
initially at a conference on 19 March 2014 and some details were reported in the media
at the time. The public announcement was on 17 April 2014, followed by publication
in Science.</font></p>

<font face="monotype corsiva" size="5" color="white"><p>The nearest-to-Earth-size planet in a habitable
zone previously known was Kepler-62f with 1.4 Earth radii. Kepler-186f orbits an M-dwarf star, while
Kepler-62f orbits a K-type star. A study of atmospheric evolution in Earth-size planets in habitable
zones of G-Stars (a class containing the Sun, but not Kepler-186) suggested that 0.8–1.15 R⊕ is the size
range for planets small enough to lose their initial accreted hydrogen envelope but large enough to retain
an outgassed secondary atmosphere such as Earth's.</p></font>
