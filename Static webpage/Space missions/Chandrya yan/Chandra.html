Chandrayaan-2 is the second lunar exploration mission developed by
the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), after Chandrayaan-1.
As of September 2019, it consists of a lunar orbiter, and also included the
Vikram lander, and the Pragyan lunar rover, all of which were developed in
India. The main scientific objective is to map and study the variations in lunar
surface composition, as well as the location and abundance of lunar water.

The spacecraft was launched on its mission to the Moon from the second launch 
pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh on 22 July 2019 at
2.43 p.m. IST (09:13 UTC) by a GSLV Mark III M1. The craft reached the Moon's orbit 
on 20 August 2019 and began orbital positioning manoeuvres for the landing of the 
Vikram lander. The lander and the rover were scheduled to land on the near side of the
Moon, in the south polar region at a latitude of about 70 degree south on 6 September 2019 and
conduct scientific experiments for one lunar day, which approximates to two Earth weeks.
A successful soft landing would have made India the fourth country after the Soviet Union, 
United States and China to do so.</font></p>
