New Horizons is an interplanetary space probe that was
 launched as a part of NASA's New Frontiers program.
Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics 
Laboratory (APL) and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI),
with a team led by S. Alan Stern,[5] the spacecraft was launched 
in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto
system in 2015, and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or 
more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, which
became a mission to 486958 Arrokoth. It is the fifth space probe to 
achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System.
